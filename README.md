# Bash-Scripts

Introduction:
-----------------------------
In this repository im pushing all the scripts I have created while studying and implementing the shell scripting. 

Local-websetup:
-----------------------------
This contains a shell file with the script use case. sample use case, we have some commands to execute which will set up the website for us.

So instead of doing that, manually, running all the commands, we are going to write a script to do that.
So I'm going to call this script as Web site, setup script.

So I know all the commands to set up the website.
I'm talking about the similar example we've seen in Linux download it from tooplate.com and set it up so we know all the commands.

I'm going to simply record all those commands in this text file, which is basically my script.
